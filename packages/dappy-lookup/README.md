# dappy-lookup

A library written in Typescript that resolves names from Dappy name system (DappyNS).

DappyNS is a next generation name system which:

- Is compliant with [DNS RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035)
- Security-first designed by implementing DNS over HTTPS ([RFC 8484](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8484))
- Persisted and distributed by blockchain [RChain](https://rchain.coop/)
- Enable clients to query in a trustless manner name records on the blockchain using:
  - A network of dappy name servers highly secured
  - A [co-resolution mecanism](https://fabco.gitbook.io/dappy-spec/glossary/multi-request) to distribute the trust over the network

DappyNS is a trustless and secure way to distribute your public data with your partners, clients or devices (IOT). PKI certificates are good candidates.
DappyNS can also help to organize and publish your DAO data due to to its hierarchical nature.

## Try it with the CLI

```sh
npx @fabcotech/dappy-lookup fabcotech A --network=gamma
```

## DappyNS documentation

You can find documentation [here](https://fabco.gitbook.io/dappy-spec/specs-and-web-standards/name-system).

## Installing

### Node.js

```sh
npm i -S @fabcotech/dappy-lookup
```

## Examples

### Stand-alone dappy lookup

Here is an example to get you started:

```typescript
import { lookup } from 'dappy-lookup';

async function run() {
    // lookup the A records for example.dappy on d network
    const packetA = await lookup('example.dappy', 'A');
    console.log(packet);

    // lookup the AAAA records for example.dappy on d network
    const packetAAAA = await lookup('example.dappy', 'AAAA');
    console.log(packet);

    // lookup the CERT records for example.dappy on d network
    const packetCERT = await lookup('example.dappy', 'CERT');
    console.log(packet);
});

run();
```

This example above will resolve a name on default dappy network which is the `d` network, which is the DappyNS production ready network.

Next example do the same but on `gamma` network (used for testing purposes)

```typescript
import { lookup } from 'dappy-lookup';

async function run() {
    // lookup the A records for example.dappy on gamma network
    const packetA = await lookup('example.dappy', 'A', { network: 'gamma' });
    console.log(packetA);
});

run();
```

### NodeJS request using dappy-lookup with CA certificate retrieval

It's a really a pain point to get a valid CA certificate and to install it at operating system level.

On DappyNS, name servers not only distribute IPv4 (**A** records) and IPv6 addresses (**AAAA** records) but also certificates to trust over **CERT** records (alternative of [DANE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6698)). It enable dappy-lookup client to fetch dynamically and in a trusted manner (using coresolution mecanism) CA certificates.

The example below demonstrates how to do this:

```typescript
import { lookup, nodeLookup } from 'dappy-lookup';

const { answers: [{ data: ca }]} = await lookup('example.dappy', 'CERT')

https.get('https://example.dappy/', {
    lookup: nodeLookup,
    ca,
}, (res) => {
  ...
});
```

NodeJS enables to override [lookup function](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httprequesturl-options-callback) for [HTTP](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) and [HTTPS](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html) native modules.

So dappy-lookup provide a lookup function (created with `nodeLookup`) with the same signature as [dns.lookup](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html#dnslookuphostname-options-callback) provided by NodeJS.

### NodeJS requests using dappy-lookup

The example below shows how to replace native NodeJS lookup function with the dappy-lookup equivalent function. In this example the certificate is not recovered dynamically, it is installed previously on the operating system.

```typescript
import { nodeLookup } from 'dappy-lookup';

https.get('https://example.dappy/', {
    lookup: nodeLookup,
}, (res) => {
  ...
});
```
