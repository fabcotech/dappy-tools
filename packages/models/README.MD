### Models

This repo is not a typical JS repo it has no dependency or package.json file. This code is replicated in three repositories that need the models / utils / types.

Models / utils / types should be modified here only. Tests and execution takes place in the other repositories.

sudo chmod +x copy_in_repos.sh
